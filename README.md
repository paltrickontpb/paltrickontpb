### Welcome to Paltrickontpb's Github Page âœ¨

Hey all, I am Projjal Gupta. I am a research assistant for the NSF Space, High Performance and Resilient Computing (SHREC) Lab at the University of Florida. My research encompasses the study of cutting-edge hardware which makes use of In-Memory, Near-Memory and Graph Processing Techniques. I have recently started working with AI frameworks and aim to accelerate training/inference using the above mentioned techniques. I also do a bit of FPGA/Embedded Stuff during my free time.

### What am I working on right now?
- In-Memory Processing on UPMEM PIMs
- Near memory processing and Data movement studies (target: Samsung CXL-PNM)
