### Welcome to Paltrickontpb's Github Page âœ¨

Hey all, I am Projjal Gupta. I am a research assistant for the NSF Space, High Performance and Resilient Computing (SHREC) Lab at the University of Florida. I research novel hardware devices with the the intention of integrating them with existing High Performance Computing (HPC) Clusters. Currently, I am building a custom compute architecture using cache-coherent interconnects and memory-compute devices to reduce data movement bottlenecks existing on traditional hardware. I also do a bit of FPGA/Embedded Stuff during my free time.

### What am I working on right now?
- Researching Memory-Compute Devices (In-memory and Near-memory Processors)
- Device-Agnostic Benchmarking using Proxy Applications (aka skeleton apps)
- Heterogeneous compute cluster design
