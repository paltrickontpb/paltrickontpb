### Welcome to Paltrickontpb's Github Page âœ¨

Hey all, I am Projjal Gupta. I love working on VLSI and CAD tools and have designed many circuits, PCBs, and HDL designs. I even work on microcontroller designs and other cool retro tech designs. I'm a huge fan of the 8051 and even base some designs around it. And sometimes tinker around blockchain applications and try to integrate them to low-powered IoT solutions. Feel free to check my projects out and follow me!

# What am I working on right now?
- Right now I am working as an Intern at Keydabra Inc. (its an amazing startup).
- Verilog Testbench Generators (From Scratch using c++)
- Memory Compilers using Leaf Cells (Probably TSMC018 if I can get the tech)
- Chisel HDL based digital circuit designs. (Can we agree that it is as amazing as Verilog)
- Risc V core. (Tough stuff, but its making some progress)
